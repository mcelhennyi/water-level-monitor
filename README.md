# Water Level  Monitor
This project specifies the hardware and software necessary to monitor the water level within a tank of water.

## The Problem
My parents live outside of the city and have a well that they use to collect water for use. This well fills a ~1000 gallon tank. The logic for the well pump is to pump until the tank is full. Currently this consists of a float connected to a switch. Once the float rises high-enough the switch disconnects the power to the well. Conversely onces the float falls far enough it triggers the pump to turn on. Additionally there is a water level indicator float that has a pipe connected to it with red markings to show the amount of water in the tank for manual intervention. This system will replecate these two features.
